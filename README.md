# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter. Hate Speech recognition

![Blight]


## Overview
Labeled racist, sexist, and homophobic tweets


## Business Problem


## Approach

General Approach for this problem was based on Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)
Which includes all following pmpotrtant steps: 

1. Look at the big picture. 
2. Get the data. 
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights. 
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms. 
5. Select a model and train it. 
6. Fine-tune your model. 
7. Present your solution. 
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain system.

## Methodology

Based on our buisness problem we are trying to accomplish certain tasks that involve natural language. 
NLP allows computers to interact with text data in a structured and sensible way. With NLP, computers are taught to understand human language, its meaning and sentiments. In order to translate complex natural human language into systematic constructed features we need to foolow some major steps:
